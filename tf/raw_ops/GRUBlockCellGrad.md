<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Args
    x: Input to the GRU cell.
    h_prev: State input from the previous GRU cell.
    w_ru: Weight matrix for the reset and update gate.
    w_c: Weight matrix for the cell connection gate.
    b_ru: Bias vector for the reset and update gate.
    b_c: Bias vector for the cell connection gate.
    r: Output of the reset gate.
    u: Output of the update gate.
    c: Output of the cell connection gate.
    d_h: Gradients of the h_new wrt to objective function.

Returns
    d_x: Gradients of the x wrt to objective function.
    d_h_prev: Gradients of the h wrt to objective function.
    d_c_bar Gradients of the c_bar wrt to objective function.
    d_r_bar_u_bar Gradients of the r_bar & u_bar wrt to objective function.

This kernel op implements the following mathematical equations:

Note on notation of the variables:

Concatenation of a and b is represented by a_b
Element-wise dot product of a and b is represented by ab
Element-wise dot product is represented by \circ
Matrix multiplication is represented by *

Additional notes for clarity:

`w_ru` can be segmented into 4 different matrices.
```
w_ru = [w_r_x w_u_x
        w_r_h_prev w_u_h_prev]
```
Similarly, `w_c` can be segmented into 2 different matrices.
```
w_c = [w_c_x w_c_h_prevr]
```
Same goes for biases.
```
b_ru = [b_ru_x b_ru_h]
b_c = [b_c_x b_c_h]
```
Another note on notation:
```
d_x = d_x_component_1 + d_x_component_2

where d_x_component_1 = d_r_bar * w_r_x^T + d_u_bar * w_r_x^T
and d_x_component_2 = d_c_bar * w_c_x^T

d_h_prev = d_h_prev_component_1 + d_h_prevr \circ r + d_h \circ u
where d_h_prev_componenet_1 = d_r_bar * w_r_h_prev^T + d_u_bar * w_r_h_prev^T
```

Mathematics behind the Gradients below:
```
d_c_bar = d_h \circ (1-u) \circ (1-c \circ c)
d_u_bar = d_h \circ (h-c) \circ u \circ (1-u)

d_r_bar_u_bar = [d_r_bar d_u_bar]

[d_x_component_1 d_h_prev_component_1] = d_r_bar_u_bar * w_ru^T

[d_x_component_2 d_h_prevr] = d_c_bar * w_c^T

d_x = d_x_component_1 + d_x_component_2

d_h_prev = d_h_prev_component_1 + d_h_prevr \circ r + u
```
Below calculation is performed in the python wrapper for the Gradients
(not in the gradient kernel.)
```
d_w_ru = x_h_prevr^T * d_c_bar

d_w_c = x_h_prev^T * d_r_bar_u_bar

d_b_ru = sum of d_r_bar_u_bar along axis = 0

d_b_c = sum of d_c_bar along axis = 0
