<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

The `x`, and `y` tensors must all have the same shape, and the
output will also have that shape.

The `condition` tensor must be a scalar if `x` and `y` are scalars.
If `x` and `y` are vectors or higher rank, then `condition` must be either a
scalar, a vector with size matching the first dimension of `x`, or must have
the same shape as `x`.

The `condition` tensor acts as a mask that chooses, based on the value at each
element, whether the corresponding element / row in the output should be
taken from `x` (if true) or `y` (if false).

If `condition` is a vector and `x` and `y` are higher rank matrices, then
it chooses which row (outer dimension) to copy from `x` and `y`.
If `condition` has the same shape as `x` and `y`, then it chooses which
element to copy from `x` and `y`.

#### For example:



```python
# 'condition' tensor is [[True,  False]
#                        [False, True]]
# 't' is [[1, 2],
#         [3, 4]]
# 'e' is [[5, 6],
#         [7, 8]]
select(condition, t, e)  # => [[1, 6], [7, 4]]


# 'condition' tensor is [True, False]
# 't' is [[1, 2],
#         [3, 4]]
# 'e' is [[5, 6],
#         [7, 8]]
select(condition, t, e) ==> [[1, 2],
                             [7, 8]]
