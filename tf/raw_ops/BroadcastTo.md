Broadcasting is the process of making arrays to have compatible shapes
for arithmetic operations. Two shapes are compatible if for each
dimension pair they are either equal or one of them is one. When trying
to broadcast a Tensor to a shape, it starts with the trailing dimensions,
and works its way forward.

For example,

```
>>> x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
>>> y = tf.broadcast_to(x, [3, 3])
>>> print(y)
tf.Tensor(
    [[1 2 3]
     [1 2 3]
     [1 2 3]], shape=(3, 3), dtype=int32)
```

In the above example, the input Tensor with the shape of `[1, 3]`
is broadcasted to output Tensor with shape of `[3, 3]`.

When doing broadcasted operations such as multiplying a tensor
by a scalar, broadcasting (usually) confers some time or space
benefit, as the broadcasted tensor is never materialized.

However, `broadcast_to` does not carry with it any such benefits.
The newly-created tensor takes the full memory of the broadcasted
shape. (In a graph context, `broadcast_to` might be fused to
subsequent operation and then be optimized away, however.)
