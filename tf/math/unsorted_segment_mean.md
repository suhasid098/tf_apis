<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Read [the section on
segmentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math#about_segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

This operator is similar to the <a href="../../tf/math/unsorted_segment_sum.md"><code>tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum</code></a> operator.
Instead of computing the sum over segments, it computes the mean of all
entries belonging to a segment such that:

\\(output_i = 1/N_i \sum_{j...} data[j...]\\) where the sum is over tuples
`j...` such that `segment_ids[j...] == i` with \\N_i\\ being the number of
occurrences of id \\i\\.

If there is no entry for a given segment ID `i`, it outputs 0.

If the given segment ID `i` is negative, the value is dropped and will not
be added to the sum of the segment.

Caution: On CPU, values in `segment_ids` are always validated to be less than
`num_segments`, and an error is thrown for out-of-bound indices. On GPU, this
does not throw an error for out-of-bound indices. On Gpu, out-of-bound indices
result in safe but unspecified behavior, which may include ignoring
out-of-bound indices or outputting a tensor with a 0 stored in the first
dimension of its shape if `num_segments` is 0.
