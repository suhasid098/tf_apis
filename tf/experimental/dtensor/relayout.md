<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Changes the layout of `tensor` to `layout`. This is used to fine-tune the
behavior of ops following/connected to `tensor`, such as choosing one SPMD
expansion pattern over another. This works by forward propagating `layout`
to connected TensorFlow computation graphs during layout propagation.

Currently, only converting layouts from replicated to sharded or sharded to
replicated per mesh dimension is supported. That is, "x, y" -> "unsharded, y"
is supported, while "x, y" -> "z, y" is not supported.

We also support a special "match" sharding spec, which instructs the relayout
to act as an identity operation with respect to any sharding on these
mesh dimensions.

Relayout is internally lowered to a set of Split and/or AllToAll ops. When
tensor layouts are converted from replicated to sharded, the cost is
comparatively low because we only insert Split ops and no cross-device
communication is needed. However, when tensor layouts are converted from
sharded to replicated, cross-device communication may occur, causing potential
performance impact.
