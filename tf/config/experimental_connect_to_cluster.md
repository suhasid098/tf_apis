<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Will make devices on the cluster available to use. Note that calling this more
than once will work, but will invalidate any tensor handles on the old remote
devices.

If the given local job name is not present in the cluster specification, it
will be automatically added, using an unused port on the localhost.

Device filters can be specified to isolate groups of remote tasks to avoid
undesired accesses between workers. Workers accessing resources or launching
ops / functions on filtered remote devices will result in errors (unknown
devices). For any remote task, if no device filter is present, all cluster
devices will be visible; if any device filter is specified, it can only
see devices matching at least one filter. Devices on the task itself are
always visible. Device filters can be particially specified.

For example, for a cluster set up for parameter server training, the following
device filters might be specified:

```python
cdf = tf.config.experimental.ClusterDeviceFilters()
# For any worker, only the devices on PS nodes and itself are visible
for i in range(num_workers):
  cdf.set_device_filters('worker', i, ['/job:ps'])
# Similarly for any ps, only the devices on workers and itself are visible
for i in range(num_ps):
  cdf.set_device_filters('ps', i, ['/job:worker'])

tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(cluster_def,
                                          cluster_device_filters=cdf)
```

If True and a cluster resolver is passed, will

master becomes the default device to run ops. It won't do anything if
a cluster spec is passed. Will throw an error if the caller is currently
already in some device scope.
