Computes softmax cross entropy between `logits` and `labels`. (deprecated arguments)

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-py tfo-signature-link">
<code>tf.compat.v1.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2(
    labels, logits, axis=None, name=None, dim=None
)
</code></pre>

Deprecated: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(dim)`. They will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
dim is deprecated, use axis instead

Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which the
classes are mutually exclusive (each entry is in exactly one class).  For
example, each CIFAR-10 image is labeled with one and only one label: an image
can be a dog or a truck, but not both.

**NOTE:**  While the classes are mutually exclusive, their probabilities
need not be.  All that is required is that each row of `labels` is
a valid probability distribution.  If they are not, the computation of the
gradient will be incorrect.

If using exclusive `labels` (wherein one and only
one class is true at a time), see `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.

**WARNING:** This op expects unscaled logits, since it performs a `softmax`
on `logits` internally for efficiency.  Do not call this op with the
output of `softmax`, as it will produce incorrect results.

A common use case is to have logits and labels of shape
`[batch_size, num_classes]`, but higher dimensions are supported, with
the `axis` argument specifying the class dimension.

`logits` and `labels` must have the same dtype (either `float16`, `float32`,
or `float64`).

Backpropagation will happen into both `logits` and `labels`.  To disallow
backpropagation into `labels`, pass label tensors through <a href="../../../../tf/stop_gradient.md"><code>tf.stop_gradient</code></a>
before feeding it to this function.

**Note that to avoid confusion, it is required to pass only named arguments to
this function.**
