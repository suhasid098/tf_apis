<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Deprecated: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by <a href="../../../../tf/data.md"><code>tf.data</code></a>. Use `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle(min_after_dequeue).batch(batch_size)`.

This function adds the following to the current `Graph`:

* A shuffling queue into which tensors from `tensors` are enqueued.
* A `dequeue_many` operation to create batches from the queue.
* A `QueueRunner` to `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection, to enqueue the tensors
  from `tensors`.

If `enqueue_many` is `False`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a
single example.  An input tensor with shape `[x, y, z]` will be output
as a tensor with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a
batch of examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example,
and all members of `tensors` should have the same size in the
first dimension.  If an input tensor has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the
output will have shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

The `capacity` argument controls the how long the prefetching is allowed to
grow the queues.

The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
<a href="../../../../tf/errors/OutOfRangeError.md"><code>tf.errors.OutOfRangeError</code></a> if the input queue is exhausted. If this
operation is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch
this exception, however, if this operation is used in your main thread
you are responsible for catching this yourself.

#### For example:



```python
# Creates batches of 32 images and 32 labels.
image_batch, label_batch = tf.compat.v1.train.shuffle_batch(
      [single_image, single_label],
      batch_size=32,
      num_threads=4,
      capacity=50000,
      min_after_dequeue=10000)
```

*N.B.:* You must ensure that either (i) the `shapes` argument is
passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in `tensors` must have
fully-defined shapes. `ValueError` will be raised if neither of
these conditions holds.

If `allow_smaller_final_batch` is `True`, a smaller batch value than
`batch_size` is returned when the queue is closed and there are not enough
elements to fill the batch, otherwise the pending elements are discarded.
In addition, all output tensors' static shapes, as accessed via the
`shape` property will have a first `Dimension` value of `None`, and
operations that depend on fixed batch_size would fail.
