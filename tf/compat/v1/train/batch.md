<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Deprecated: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by <a href="../../../../tf/data.md"><code>tf.data</code></a>. Use <a href="../../../../tf/data/Dataset.md#batch"><code>tf.data.Dataset.batch(batch_size)</code></a> (or `padded_batch(...)` if `dynamic_pad=True`).

The argument `tensors` can be a list or a dictionary of tensors.
The value returned by the function will be of the same type
as `tensors`.

This function is implemented using a queue. A `QueueRunner` for the
queue is added to the current `Graph`'s `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection.

If `enqueue_many` is `False`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a single
example.  An input tensor with shape `[x, y, z]` will be output as a tensor
with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a batch of
examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example, and all members of
`tensors` should have the same size in the first dimension.  If an input
tensor has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the output will have shape `[batch_size, x,
y, z]`.  The `capacity` argument controls the how long the prefetching is
allowed to grow the queues.

The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
<a href="../../../../tf/errors/OutOfRangeError.md"><code>tf.errors.OutOfRangeError</code></a> if the input queue is exhausted. If this
operation is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch
this exception, however, if this operation is used in your main thread
you are responsible for catching this yourself.

*N.B.:* If `dynamic_pad` is `False`, you must ensure that either
(i) the `shapes` argument is passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in
`tensors` must have fully-defined shapes. `ValueError` will be
raised if neither of these conditions holds.

If `dynamic_pad` is `True`, it is sufficient that the *rank* of the
tensors is known, but individual dimensions may have shape `None`.
In this case, for each enqueue the dimensions with value `None`
may have a variable length; upon dequeue, the output tensors will be padded
on the right to the maximum shape of the tensors in the current minibatch.
For numbers, this padding takes value 0.  For strings, this padding is
the empty string.  See `PaddingFIFOQueue` for more info.

If `allow_smaller_final_batch` is `True`, a smaller batch value than
`batch_size` is returned when the queue is closed and there are not enough
elements to fill the batch, otherwise the pending elements are discarded.
In addition, all output tensors' static shapes, as accessed via the
`shape` property will have a first `Dimension` value of `None`, and
operations that depend on fixed batch_size would fail.
