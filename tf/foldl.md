foldl on the list of tensors unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0. (deprecated argument values)

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-py tfo-signature-link">
<code>tf.foldl(
    fn,
    elems,
    initializer=None,
    parallel_iterations=10,
    back_prop=True,
    swap_memory=False,
    name=None
)
</code></pre>



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Deprecated: SOME ARGUMENT VALUES ARE DEPRECATED: `(back_prop=False)`. They will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
back_prop=False is deprecated. Consider using tf.stop_gradient instead.
Instead of:
results = tf.foldl(fn, elems, back_prop=False)
Use:
results = tf.nest.map_structure(tf.stop_gradient, tf.foldl(fn, elems))

This foldl operator repeatedly applies the callable `fn` to a sequence
of elements from first to last. The elements are made of the tensors
unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0. The callable fn takes two tensors as
arguments. The first argument is the accumulated value computed from the
preceding invocation of fn, and the second is the value at the current
position of `elems`. If `initializer` is None, `elems` must contain at least
one element, and its first element is used as the initializer.

Suppose that `elems` is unpacked into `values`, a list of tensors. The shape
of the result tensor is fn(initializer, values[0]).shape`.

This method also allows multi-arity `elems` and output of `fn`.  If `elems`
is a (possibly nested) list or tuple of tensors, then each of these tensors
must have a matching first (unpack) dimension.  The signature of `fn` may
match the structure of `elems`.  That is, if `elems` is
`(t1, [t2, t3, [t4, t5]])`, then an appropriate signature for `fn` is:
`fn = lambda (t1, [t2, t3, [t4, t5]]):`.

sum = foldl(lambda a, x: a + x, elems)
