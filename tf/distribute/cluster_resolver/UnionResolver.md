<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This class performs a union given two or more existing ClusterResolvers. It
merges the underlying ClusterResolvers, and returns one unified ClusterSpec
when cluster_spec is called. The details of the merge function is
documented in the cluster_spec function.

For additional ClusterResolver properties such as task type, task index,
rpc layer, environment, etc..., we will return the value from the first
ClusterResolver in the union.

An example to combine two cluster resolvers:

  ```Python
  cluster_0 = tf.train.ClusterSpec({"worker": ["worker0.example.com:2222",
                                               "worker1.example.com:2222"]})
  cluster_resolver_0 = SimpleClusterResolver(cluster, task_type="worker",
                                             task_id=0,
                                             rpc_layer="grpc")

  cluster_1 = tf.train.ClusterSpec({"ps": ["ps0.example.com:2222",
                                           "ps1.example.com:2222"]})
  cluster_resolver_1 = SimpleClusterResolver(cluster, task_type="ps",
                                             task_id=0,
                                             rpc_layer="grpc")

  # Its task type would be "worker".
  cluster_resolver = UnionClusterResolver(cluster_resolver_0,
                                          cluster_resolver_1)
  ```

An example to override the number of GPUs in a TFConfigClusterResolver
instance:

  ```Python
  tf_config = TFConfigClusterResolver()
  gpu_override = SimpleClusterResolver(tf_config.cluster_spec(),
                                       num_accelerators={"GPU": 1})
  cluster_resolver = UnionResolver(gpu_override, tf_config)
  ```

`environment`
</td>
<td>
Returns the current environment which TensorFlow is running in.

There are two possible return values, "google" (when TensorFlow is running
in a Google-internal environment) or an empty string (when TensorFlow is
running elsewhere).

If you are implementing a ClusterResolver that works in both the Google
environment and the open-source world (for instance, a TPU ClusterResolver
or similar), you will have to return the appropriate string depending on the
environment, which you will have to detect.

Otherwise, if you are implementing a ClusterResolver that will only work
in open-source TensorFlow, you do not need to implement this property.

<td>
`task_id`
</td>
<td>
Returns the task id this `ClusterResolver` indicates.

In TensorFlow distributed environment, each job may have an applicable
task id, which is the index of the instance within its task type. This is
useful when user needs to run specific code according to task index. For
example,

```python
cluster_spec = tf.train.ClusterSpec({
    "ps": ["localhost:2222", "localhost:2223"],
    "worker": ["localhost:2224", "localhost:2225", "localhost:2226"]
})

# SimpleClusterResolver is used here for illustration; other cluster
# resolvers may be used for other source of task type/id.
simple_resolver = SimpleClusterResolver(cluster_spec, task_type="worker",
                                        task_id=0)

...

if cluster_resolver.task_type == 'worker' and cluster_resolver.task_id == 0:
  # Perform something that's only applicable on 'worker' type, id 0. This
  # block will run on this particular instance since we've specified this
  # task to be a 'worker', id 0 in above cluster resolver.
else:
  # Perform something that's only applicable on other ids. This block will
  # not run on this particular instance.
```

Returns `None` if such information is not available or is not applicable
in the current distributed environment, such as training with
<a href="../../../tf/distribute/cluster_resolver/TPUClusterResolver.md"><code>tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver</code></a>.

For more information, please see
<a href="../../../tf/distribute/cluster_resolver/ClusterResolver.md"><code>tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.ClusterResolver</code></a>'s class docstring.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>
`task_type`
</td>
<td>
Returns the task type this `ClusterResolver` indicates.

In TensorFlow distributed environment, each job may have an applicable
task type. Valid task types in TensorFlow include
'chief': a worker that is designated with more responsibility,
'worker': a regular worker for training/evaluation,
'ps': a parameter server, or
'evaluator': an evaluator that evaluates the checkpoints for metrics.

See [Multi-worker configuration](
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras#multi-worker_configuration)
for more information about 'chief' and 'worker' task type, which are most
commonly used.

Having access to such information is useful when user needs to run specific
code according to task types. For example,

```python
cluster_spec = tf.train.ClusterSpec({
    "ps": ["localhost:2222", "localhost:2223"],
    "worker": ["localhost:2224", "localhost:2225", "localhost:2226"]
})

# SimpleClusterResolver is used here for illustration; other cluster
# resolvers may be used for other source of task type/id.
simple_resolver = SimpleClusterResolver(cluster_spec, task_type="worker",
                                        task_id=1)

...

if cluster_resolver.task_type == 'worker':
  # Perform something that's only applicable on workers. This block
  # will run on this particular instance since we've specified this task to
  # be a worker in above cluster resolver.
elif cluster_resolver.task_type == 'ps':
  # Perform something that's only applicable on parameter servers. This
  # block will not run on this particular instance.
```

Returns `None` if such information is not available or is not applicable
in the current distributed environment, such as training with
<a href="../../../tf/distribute/experimental/TPUStrategy.md"><code>tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy</code></a>.

## Methods

<h3 id="cluster_spec"><code>cluster_spec</code></h3>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-py tfo-signature-link">
<code>cluster_spec()
</code></pre>

Returns a union of all the ClusterSpecs from the ClusterResolvers.

<tr><th colspan="2">Raises</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>
`KeyError`
</td>
<td>
If there are conflicting keys detected when merging two or
more dictionaries, this exception is raised.
</td>
</tr>
</table>


Note: If there are multiple ClusterResolvers exposing ClusterSpecs with the
same job name, we will merge the list/dict of workers.

If *all* underlying ClusterSpecs expose the set of workers as lists, we will
concatenate the lists of workers, starting with the list of workers from
the first ClusterResolver passed into the constructor.

If *any* of the ClusterSpecs expose the set of workers as a dict, we will
treat all the sets of workers as dicts (even if they are returned as lists)
and will only merge them into a dict if there is no conflicting keys. If
there is a conflicting key, we will raise a `KeyError`.

<h3 id="master"><code>master</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" class="external" href="/code/stable/tensorflow/python/distribute/cluster_resolver/cluster_resolver.py">View source</a>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-py tfo-signature-link">
<code>master(
    task_type=None, task_id=None, rpc_layer=None
)
</code></pre>

Returns the master address to use when creating a session.

This usually returns the master from the first ClusterResolver passed in,
but you can override this by specifying the task_type and task_id.

Note: this is only useful for TensorFlow 1.x.

This returns the number of accelerator cores (such as GPUs and TPUs)
available per worker.

Optionally, we allow callers to specify the task_type, and task_id, for
if they want to target a specific TensorFlow task to query
the number of accelerators. This is to support heterogenous environments,
where the number of accelerators cores per host is different.
