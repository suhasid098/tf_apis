<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Normalizes a tensor by `mean` and `variance`, and applies (optionally) a
`scale` \\(\gamma\\) to it, as well as an `offset` \\(\beta\\):

\\(\frac{\gamma(x-\mu)}{\sigma}+\beta\\)

`mean`, `variance`, `offset` and `scale` are all expected to be of one of two
shapes:

  * In all generality, they can have the same number of dimensions as the
    input `x`, with identical sizes as `x` for the dimensions that are not
    normalized over (the 'depth' dimension(s)), and dimension 1 for the
    others which are being normalized over.
    `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of
    <a href="../../tf/nn/moments.md"><code>tf.nn.moments(..., keepdims=True)</code></a> during training, or running averages
    thereof during inference.
  * In the common case where the 'depth' dimension is the last dimension in
    the input tensor `x`, they may be one dimensional tensors of the same
    size as the 'depth' dimension.
    This is the case for example for the common `[batch, depth]` layout of
    fully-connected layers, and `[batch, height, width, depth]` for
    convolutions.
    `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of
    <a href="../../tf/nn/moments.md"><code>tf.nn.moments(..., keepdims=False)</code></a> during training, or running averages
    thereof during inference.
