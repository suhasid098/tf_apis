<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

There is often a need to lift variable initialization ops out of control-flow
scopes, function-building graphs, and gradient tapes. Entering an
`init_scope` is a mechanism for satisfying these desiderata. In particular,
entering an `init_scope` has three effects:

  (1) All control dependencies are cleared the moment the scope is entered;
      this is equivalent to entering the context manager returned from
      `control_dependencies(None)`, which has the side-effect of exiting
      control-flow scopes like <a href="../tf/cond.md"><code>tf.cond</code></a> and <a href="../tf/while_loop.md"><code>tf.while_loop</code></a>.

  (2) All operations that are created while the scope is active are lifted
      into the lowest context on the `context_stack` that is not building a
      graph function. Here, a context is defined as either a graph or an eager
      context. Every context switch, i.e., every installation of a graph as
      the default graph and every switch into eager mode, is logged in a
      thread-local stack called `context_switches`; the log entry for a
      context switch is popped from the stack when the context is exited.
      Entering an `init_scope` is equivalent to crawling up
      `context_switches`, finding the first context that is not building a
      graph function, and entering it. A caveat is that if graph mode is
      enabled but the default graph stack is empty, then entering an
      `init_scope` will simply install a fresh graph as the default one.

  (3) The gradient tape is paused while the scope is active.

When eager execution is enabled, code inside an init_scope block runs with
eager execution enabled even when tracing a <a href="../tf/function.md"><code>tf.function</code></a>. For example:

```python
tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

@tf.function
def func():
  # A function constructs TensorFlow graphs,
  # it does not execute eagerly.
  assert not tf.executing_eagerly()
  with tf.init_scope():
    # Initialization runs with eager execution enabled
    assert tf.executing_eagerly()
```
